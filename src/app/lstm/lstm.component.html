        <h2>Long Short-Term Memory Alogrithm</h2>
        <p>
            Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order
            dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like
            machine translation, speech recognition, and more.
            LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning.

            <h4>LSTM using Keras</h4>
            <p>Generate a model using LSTM algorithm
                which described with 3 hidden layers to give a more efficient result.

            <p>Firstly, we define the Hyperparametrs and preprocess the text:

            <h4>Create LSTM model </h4>

            <p>Letâ€™s make a sequential model now with the first layer as the
                word embedding layer.And then applying LSTM layer and, one
                more dense layer with activation as Relu, and a regularizer
                to avoid over-fitting again are then added.The output layer
                has softmax so as to get the probability of the word to be predicted next:</p>

            </h4>

            <p>Now,we convert categorical variable (influence in our case )into dummy/indicator variables then, we
                split the data into train and test sets:</p>
