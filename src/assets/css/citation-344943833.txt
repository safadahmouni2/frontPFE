Haffar, Nafaa & Hkiri, Emna & Zrigui, Mounir. (2019). Arabic linguistic resource and specifications for event annotation. Automatic event extraction is an important task for many natural language processing (NLP) systems. This task requires a thorough knowledge of the ontological and grammatical characteristics of events in the text as well as annotated linguistic resources of the events. In this article, we present a linguistic guideline for the annotation of events in Arabic texts based on the temporal markup language TimeML. We also present a manually annotated corpus of events in Arabic texts which follows our created and corrected guideline.
